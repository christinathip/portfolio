      <h1>My Background</h1>
      <p>My name is Christina Thiphavong, "CT".</p>
      <p>I'm originally from Providence, Rhode Island. Eventually my parents
        moved my brother and I to Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Which is a city outside of Nashville, Tennessee, "Music City."</p>
      <p>I attended Middle Tennesse State University, majoring in Computer
        Science and Aerospace with the concentration in Unmanned Aircraft Systems(UAS),</p>
      <p>Recently I decided to take a break from college and wanted a new scenery.</p>
      <p>Which is why I moved to Seattle.</p>
      <p>I picked Seattle because I believe there's more opportunities for this small town girl here. Especially since I want to pursue
        a career in the tech industry. I love creating and being innovated which is why I want a career in the tech industry.</p>
